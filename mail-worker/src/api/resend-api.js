// DEPRECATED: This file has been moved to the webhook/ module
// Routes are now registered in ../webhook/webhook-api.js
//
// The webhook functionality has been consolidated in the webhook/ module:
// - ../webhook/webhook-api.js - HTTP routes for Resend webhooks and webhook event logs
// - ../webhook/index.js - Module exports
//
// For backward compatibility, import from '../webhook' instead of this file.
// This file no longer registers any routes to prevent double registration.
